# WORDLE RIPOFF
WORDLE is an extremely fun game that sold to NYT for low seven figures. I want to see if I have the coding ability to make a seven figure app on my own.

### Functionality:
Pick a word from a universe of words 
keep track of words already used
only allow valid word guesses 
Keep track of game state
    - letters guessed
    - correct letters
    - letters in wrong spot
    - letters not in word
    - words guessed
    - guesses left
    - game over y or n
Then user info
   - has the user played todays word already
   - what is the user's win rate
   - what is the user's guess distribution
   - let them share them getting it correct
Honestly I think the front end will take longer since I do not enjoy front end work. Matching the design is going to be a pain...


### Progress
Pick a word from universe of words
